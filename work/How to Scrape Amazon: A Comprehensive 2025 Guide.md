## Navigating Amazonâ€™s Structure

Before scraping, it's essential to understand Amazon's layout. The search results page displays products with titles, prices, ratings, and other details. Key components include:

1. **Product Name**
2. **Price**
3. **Rating**
4. **Number of Reviews**

### Inspecting Amazonâ€™s HTML

To explore Amazon's structure:

1. Go to the Amazon website.
2. Search for a product.
3. Right-click on a product listing and select **Inspect Element**.
4. Analyze the HTML structure to identify tags and attributes for the data you want to extract.

## Scraping Amazon Products with Playwright

Here's an example of a Python script for scraping Amazon:

### Python Script: `amazon_scraper.py`

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
import pandas as pd

async def scrape_amazon():
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        browser = await pw.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto('https://www.amazon.com/s?i=fashion&bbn=115958409011')

        results = []
        listings = await page.query_selector_all('div.a-section.a-spacing-small')
        for listing in listings:
            result = {}
            name_element = await listing.query_selector('h2.a-size-mini > a > span')
            result['product_name'] = await name_element.inner_text() if name_element else 'N/A'

            rating_element = await listing.query_selector('span[aria-label*="out of 5 stars"]')
            result['rating'] = await rating_element.inner_text() if rating_element else 'N/A'

            reviews_element = await listing.query_selector('span[aria-label*="stars"] + span > a > span')
            result['number_of_reviews'] = await reviews_element.inner_text() if reviews_element else 'N/A'

            price_element = await listing.query_selector('span.a-price > span.a-offscreen')
            result['price'] = await price_element.inner_text() if price_element else 'N/A'

            results.append(result)

        await browser.close()
        return results

results = asyncio.run(scrape_amazon())
df = pd.DataFrame(results)
df.to_csv('amazon_products.csv', index=False)
```

### Running the Script

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python3 amazon_scraper.py
```

The output will be saved as a CSV file (`amazon_products.csv`) containing product details such as name, rating, reviews, and price.

## Advanced Scraping Techniques

Scraping Amazon at scale requires advanced methods to handle challenges like pagination, ads, and anti-bot measures.

### Handle Pagination

Amazon lists products across multiple pages. To scrape all products, your script must:

1. Locate the **Next** button on the page.
2. Click it programmatically.
3. Wait for the next page to load before extracting data.

### Bypass Advertisements

Ads are structured differently from organic listings. Identify and skip ads by looking for tags labeled "Sponsored" or "Ad."

### Avoid Getting Blocked

To reduce detection:

- **Rotate User Agents**: Mimic requests from different browsers.  
- **Add Delays**: Use `asyncio.sleep()` to randomize intervals between requests.  
- **Use Proxies**: Rotate IP addresses with services like **ScraperAPI** to avoid bans.
