## Why Scrape Google Maps?

If you're building a prospect list, Google Maps is an invaluable resource for finding relevant businesses. For example, a food wholesaler targeting Japanese restaurants in Los Angeles could manually search ‚Äúrestaurants in Los Angeles‚Äù and filter by cuisine type. However, this method is slow and lacks the ability to export data for further analysis.

A Google Maps scraper automates this process, collecting and exporting data such as addresses, contact info, and operating hours into formats like Excel. These tools let you extract all the information visible on Google Maps while saving time and effort, enabling you to focus on more strategic tasks.
