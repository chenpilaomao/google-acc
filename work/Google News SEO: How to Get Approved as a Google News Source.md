# Google News SEO: How to Get Approved as a Google News Source

Google News SEO can significantly boost the authority of news websites. While your site may produce outstanding content, your audience reach remains limited if your articles don‚Äôt appear in Google News. Google's news aggregator collects content from over 50,000 global sources, making Google News inclusion a major advantage. The potential benefits include increased website traffic and enhanced credibility. However, to get listed in Google News, content creators must optimize their sites and articles using specific Google News SEO strategies. Note that without being a legitimate news source, even the best SEO practices won‚Äôt guarantee approval. This guide outlines the fundamentals of Google News SEO and provides actionable tips to help you gain approval as a trusted news source.

## How Google News Indexing Works

Unlike traditional news publishers, Google News functions as an algorithm-based aggregator. It collects news stories from various sources and organizes them by interest, location, prominence, authority, freshness, and availability. The results are categorized into topics and subtopics. 

Google News algorithms determine which stories to display based on user preferences and location, as well as the authority and reliability of the sources. While most of the process is automated, Google employees occasionally curate content for major international events or trending topics, such as award ceremonies. To combat misinformation, Google prioritizes authoritative results, especially during crises or breaking news events. Publishers and journalists collaborate with Google to embed quality signals and build reliable data that ensures accurate news representation.

As shown in the image above, Google News results (right) differ from regular Google search results (left). Regular searches often include multimedia elements like videos, while Google News displays only news articles. Another unique feature is that users can customize their news feed by interacting with search results, indicating their preferences for specific topics or hiding content from certain publishers.

## Benefits of Appearing in Google News

Getting featured in Google News has advantages that extend beyond website traffic. While you might not see a significant spike in Google Analytics traffic directly from Google News, the indirect benefits can be invaluable:

1. **Credibility and Trust**: Being included in Google News signals that your brand is trustworthy and authoritative. Approved sources must publish original content and maintain a clear separation between news and sponsored content. They are also required to display accurate timestamps, author names, and publisher information.

2. **Faster Indexing**: Google News-approved content appears in search results within minutes of publication, a crucial advantage during breaking news scenarios.

3. **Increased Engagement**: Regularly publishing high-quality, engaging content can lead users to interact with your articles. These interactions help build loyalty, as users who choose to see "more stories like this" are more likely to engage with your content in the future.

4. **Prominent Display**: Inclusion in Google News enhances your chances of appearing in Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Stories‚Äù carousel, prominently displayed at the top of search results, which can drive significant traffic.

## Steps to Get Featured in Google News

If you run a news site, there are two main ways to have your content indexed in Google News: licensing your content through the Producer tool or submitting your site for inclusion via the Publisher Center.

### Producer vs. Publisher Center

- **Google News Producer**: A publishing tool for creating branded content feeds. It allows publishers to import existing content, add multimedia elements, and optimize for multiple devices. Note that Producer is not a content creation tool but a platform for repurposing and distributing content created elsewhere.
- **Publisher Center**: A portal for managing your site‚Äôs details in Google News after approval. Here, publishers can update URLs, categorize content, and optimize metadata. Submission through the Publisher Center is required before Google can crawl your news site.

## 6 Tips for Optimizing Your Site for Google News

1. **Follow Technical Guidelines**: Ensure your site can be crawled by Google. Use permanent, unique URLs for articles and rely on HTML for content and links. Avoid formats like PDFs, multimedia-heavy designs, and JavaScript that crawlers cannot interpret.

2. **Optimize for Accessibility**: Use structured data (e.g., `NewsArticle` schema) to include metadata such as titles, keywords, and publication dates. Avoid interrupting content with unrelated elements like video galleries. HTML should follow a continuous block format from title to conclusion.

3. **Establish Credibility**: Publish original, transparent content. Include clear author names, timestamps, and publisher information. Hiring expert contributors can also boost your chances of approval.

4. **Publish Daily**: Regularly update your site with multiple unique articles. While syndicated content from wire services is acceptable, your site should primarily feature original reporting.

5. **Focus on a Niche**: General news sites face stiff competition. Niche websites with unique insights or industry expertise, such as Space.com for astronomy news, have higher chances of approval.

6. **Create a News Sitemap**: Once accepted, submit a dedicated sitemap for news content. This allows Google to index your articles more efficiently. Even if you already have a general sitemap, a separate news-specific one is recommended.

## Getting Your Business News Featured

Perhaps you simply want your company announcements or industry-specific news to appear in Google News. In this case, consider using a Google News-approved press release service or partnering with industry-specific news sites. Tools like Alexa‚Äôs Audience Overlap can help you identify potential partners by clustering sites with similar keywords or audiences. 

Even if your content doesn‚Äôt get picked up by Google News, it may still appear in the ‚ÄúTop Stories‚Äù section of general Google search results.

## Conclusion

If your news site isn‚Äôt yet included in Google News, now is the time to act. While Google‚Äôs requirements may seem stringent, following these steps will not only improve your chances of approval but also enhance your website‚Äôs overall quality. Whether you‚Äôre ready to apply for publisher status or just want to explore Google News Producer, optimizing your content for Google News can open doors to new audiences and opportunities.
