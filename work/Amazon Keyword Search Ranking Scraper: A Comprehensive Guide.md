## 1. Requirements, Background, and Challenges

### **Requirements**
Businesses aim to monitor their product rankings for specific keywords. For instance, after searching for "men's shoes" on Amazon, a seller might want to see if their product appears in the top three pages of search resultsâ€”whether organically or through ads. Higher rankings typically drive more sales, making this information crucial for deciding ad placement and budget.

Hereâ€™s an example visualization of keyword ranking data:

### **Background**
Amazon operates globally with multiple marketplaces, such as the US, Germany, and Japan. Keyword rankings often vary by marketplace and delivery address, making it essential to consider both factors when analyzing search rankings.

### **Challenges**
Scraping Amazon's data involves overcoming the following hurdles:

1. **Address Configuration**  
   Resolving issues like `token`, `session-token`, `csrf-token`, `ubid-acbde`, and changing the address via API.

2. **CAPTCHA Handling**  
   Amazon triggers CAPTCHAs if IP quality is poor or requests are too frequent.

3. **Reliable IP Providers**  
   Amazon tracks suspicious IPs, so using trusted IP providers is critical.

## 2. Packet Capture Analysis

By visiting [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com) in incognito mode and using tools like Charles for packet capture, you can analyze the steps needed to switch addresses. The process can be broken into the following five steps:

### **2.1 Retrieving Session Information**
The first step involves fetching the session and related information from Amazon's homepage.

### **2.2 Fetching `ubid_acbde` Information**
The `ubid_acbde` parameter is extracted during the session initialization process.

### **2.3 Fetching Session-Token Information**
Session tokens play a vital role in maintaining user sessions during scraping.

## 3. CAPTCHA Handling

Amazon's CAPTCHA mechanisms can be grouped into three categories. While two types are relatively simple, the GIF-based CAPTCHAs require more advanced handling. Fortunately, several open-source solutions on GitHub can be customized for this purpose.

When all else fails, simply switching to a different IP can solve the issue. Thereâ€™s no need to overcomplicate this step.
