## Step-by-Step Guide to Scraping eBay

### 1. Import Required Libraries

Start by importing the necessary libraries:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

### 2. Send a Request to eBay

Use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the eBay search results page:

```python
url = "https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=laptop"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
```

### 3. Extract Organic Search Results

Identify the container for search results using tools like SelectorGadget:

```python
results = soup.select(".s-item")
for result in results:
    title = result.select_one(".s-item__title").get_text()
    price = result.select_one(".s-item__price").get_text()
    link = result.select_one(".s-item__link")["href"]
    print(f"Title: {title}, Price: {price}, Link: {link}")
```

### 4. Scrape Related Searches

Use the appropriate selector to target related searches:

```python
related_searches = soup.select(".srp-related-searches a")
for search in related_searches:
    print(search.get_text())
```
