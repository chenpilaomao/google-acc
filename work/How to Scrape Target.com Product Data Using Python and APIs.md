## DIY Scraping with Python

### Using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` Libraries

Here's how you can extract data from Target's search results manually:

1. **Send an HTTP Request:**

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=womens+sweaters"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
```

2. **Extract Product Data:**

```python
products = soup.select('div[data-test="product-grid"]')
for product in products:
    title = product.select_one('a[data-test="product-title"]').text
    price = product.select_one('span[data-test="current-price"]').text
    print(f"Title: {title}, Price: {price}")
```

## Challenges of DIY Scraping

1. **Dynamic Content:** Target uses JavaScript to load product data, which makes scraping with basic tools challenging.
2. **Scalability:** DIY scripts can trigger rate-limiting or IP bans.
3. **Website Changes:** Regular updates to Target‚Äôs structure may break your scraper.

## Scraping Target with Crawlbase Crawling API

### Step 1: Register and Get Your API Token
1. Sign up at [Crawlbase](https://crawlbase.com/signup).
2. Retrieve your API token from the [dashboard](https://crawlbase.com/dashboard/account/docs).
3. Use the JavaScript (JS) token for dynamic pages like Target.

### Step 2: Install the Crawlbase Python Library
Install the library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install crawlbase
```

### Step 3: Scrape Target Data

```python
from crawlbase import CrawlingAPI
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

crawling_api = CrawlingAPI({'token': API_TOKEN})

def scrape_target(search_term):
    url = f'https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm={quote(search_term)}'
    response = crawling_api.get(url, {'ajax_wait': 'true', 'page_wait': 5000})
    
    if response['headers']['pc_status'] == '200':
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response['body'].decode('utf-8'), 'html.parser')
        products = soup.select('div[data-test="product-grid"]')
        for product in products:
            title = product.select_one('a[data-test="product-title"]').text
            price = product.select_one('span[data-test="current-price"]').text
            print(f"Title: {title}, Price: {price}")
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data.")

scrape_target("womens sweaters")
```

## Handling Pagination

Target uses a `&Nao` parameter for pagination. Modify your script to scrape multiple pages:

```python
def scrape_paginated_data(search_term, max_pages=5):
    for page in range(max_pages):
        url = f'https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm={quote(search_term)}&Nao={page * 24}'
        response = crawling_api.get(url, {'ajax_wait': 'true', 'page_wait': 5000})
        # Process the response as shown earlier.
```
