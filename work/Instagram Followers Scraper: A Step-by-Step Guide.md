# Instagram Followers Scraper: A Step-by-Step Guide

---

## Introduction

Extracting Instagram follower lists can be challenging due to Instagramâ€™s strict policies against automated scraping. Public APIs for follower data are unavailable, and third-party tools offering such services are often targeted by Instagramâ€™s legal team. But donâ€™t worryâ€”thereâ€™s a 100% legal and undetectable way to scrape Instagram follower lists using HAR files. 

This method allows you to export Instagram followers or following lists into Excel or Google Sheets safely. By passively recording your web traffic while using Instagram normally, you can capture and process follower data without violating Instagramâ€™s terms of service. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you scrape Instagram followers from public accounts or private accounts you have access to.

## How to Scrape Instagram Followers

### 1. Scroll Through Followers

To begin, visit the Instagram profile you want to scrape in your web browser. For instance, navigate to `https://www.instagram.com/therock/` or search the username via Google with `site:instagram.com`.

Once on the profile, follow these steps:
1. Open **Developer Tools** by right-clicking on the page and selecting **Inspect** (Google Chrome is recommended but most browsers work similarly).
2. Go to the **Network** tab in Developer Tools to record web traffic.
3. Click on the followers count to open the followers list. Slowly scroll through the list to ensure all follower data is loaded into your browser.

### 2. Export a HAR File

After scrolling through the followers list:
1. Look for the **Export HAR** option in Developer Tools (usually a download arrow in the Network tab).
2. Save the HAR file to a convenient location, such as your Desktop.

Now that you have the HAR file, itâ€™s time to extract the follower data. Use tools like the [HAR File Web Scraper](https://stevesie.com/har-file-web-scraper) to parse the file and organize the data into a manageable format.

### 3. Download Instagram Followers as CSV

Once the HAR file is processed:
1. Click the **Parse Group** button in the HAR File Web Scraper to locate the `graphql` section, which contains the follower list.
2. Download the combined follower data as a CSV file.

Now you can open the CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets for analysis. Make sure to import it as a Unicode file to preserve emojis and special characters.

## Legal Concerns

### Compliance with Instagramâ€™s Terms of Service
This method is completely legal because it relies on capturing your own web traffic while browsing Instagram. Since youâ€™re not directly scraping Instagramâ€™s servers or violating their terms, you can extract follower data for personal use safely.

### Republishing Limitations
While extracting data for internal purposes is generally acceptable, redistributing this data without consent is a potential legal risk. Always ensure your usage complies with privacy laws and Instagramâ€™s policies.

### Limitations on Emails & Contact Details
Using this method, you can only extract usernamesâ€”not email addresses or phone numbers. Additionally, Instagram limits the number of followers you can load, especially for accounts with large follower counts. This means you might only be able to scrape partial lists for high-profile accounts.

## Risks of Illegal Tools

Many third-party tools claim to extract Instagram followers or contact details, but these are risky for several reasons:
1. **Legal Violations**: Tools offering email scrapers or automated actions violate Instagramâ€™s terms and can result in account bans or legal action.
2. **Unwanted Features**: Browser extensions often include hidden automation features that perform unauthorized actions on your behalf, putting your account at risk.
3. **Account Bans**: Instagram actively monitors suspicious behavior and bans accounts for violations, especially automated scraping attempts.

Instead of using risky tools, focus on legal and targeted strategies for gathering data or outreach.

## Conclusion

Scraping Instagram followers legally and safely is possible using HAR files and proper parsing tools. This method lets you analyze follower lists for research, marketing, or internal purposes without violating Instagramâ€™s terms. Just remember to respect privacy laws and avoid redistributing data without permission.
